  "description": "In this assignment I needed to modify starter code to create an application using a google api to search books. The application didn't only search for books but allowed you to create a username to be able to log in. For our server side we had to add our apollo server and create a schema folder to add the resolvers and our typeDefs. The typeDefs is for us to connect our database to mongoose. For the front end we had to make small changed in our LoginForms.js, and SignupForm.js so we can connect it with our mutations.js file which will allow us to signup and log in to our created account.",

# API-Google-Book-Search

## Description

In this assignment I needed to modify starter code to create an application using a google api to search books. The application didn't only search for books but allowed you to create a username to be able to log in. For our server side we had to add our apollo server and create a schema folder to add the resolvers and our typeDefs. The typeDefs is for us to connect our database to mongoose. For the front end we had to make small changed in our LoginForms.js, and SignupForm.js so we can connect it with our mutations.js file which will allow us to signup and log in to our created account. 



## Github 

On Github I was able to create a new repository where I was able to push all my work to. Before even starting the challenge I had to clone the new repository to the my computer first. I cloned it using my gitbash, from there on any code I worked on visual studio code I was able to save it and push it back to my repository. Once all my work was done I did a final push and created a deployed site. 




## Heroku

For this assignment we had to deploy our application to heroku. I logged into my Heroku account and connected it to my github. Then I was able to search my repository to create the deployed application.
